## Overview

Septoria leaf spot, also called Septoria blight, occurs throughout the United States and worldwide wherever tomatoes are grown.
This disease can be quite destructive and crop losses of up to 100% have been reported in heavily defoliated fields.
Septoria leaf spot is primarily a disease of tomato, but it has been reported on other Solanaceous hosts including eggplant, potato, petunia, horsenettle, and black nightshade.

## Symptoms and Disease Development

Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. This fungus can attack tomatoes at any stage of development, but symptoms usually first appear on the older, lower leaves and stems when plants are setting fruit. Symptoms usually appear on leaves, but can occur on petioles, stems, and the calyx. The first symptoms appear as small, water-soaked, circular spots 1/16 to 1/8" in diameter on the undersides of older leaves. The centers of these spots then turn gray to tan and have a dark-brown margin. The spots are distinctively circular and are often quite numerous. As the spots age, they sometimes enlarge and often coalesce. A diagnostic feature of this disease is the presence of many dark-brown, pimple-like structures called pycnidia (fruiting bodies of the fungus) that are readily visible in the tan centers of the spots. When spots are numerous, affected leaves turn yellow and eventually shrivel up, brown, and drop off. Defoliation usually starts on the oldest leaves and can quickly spread progressively up the plant toward the new growth. Significant losses can result from early leaf-drop and often leads to the subsequent sunscalding of the fruit when plants are prematurely defoliated

## Overview

Target spot of tomato is caused by the fungal pathogen Corynespora cassiicola.1 The disease occurs on field-grown tomatoes in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Target spot was first observed on tomatoes in the U.S. in Immokalee, Florida in 1967.

## Symptoms

The target spot fungus can infect all above-ground parts of the tomato plant. Plants are most susceptible as seedlings and just before and during fruiting. The initial foliar symptoms are pinpoint-sized, water-soaked spots on the upper leaf surface (Figure 1a). The spots develop into small, necrotic lesions that have light brown centers and dark margins.

## Overview

Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a member of family tobamoviridae and belongs to the genus tobamovirus, which is a plant pathogenic virus. It is found worldwide and affects tomatoes and many other wide host range plants including many agricultural crops and weeds such as tobacco and beans, all of which can serve as inoculum sources. The tomato crop is highly susceptible to the Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). The symptoms vary from tiles, wrinkle, reduction and curvature of leaflets, and irregular ripening of fruits. This disease requires attention because of its easy dissemination by contact, cultural practices, or contaminated seed.

## Symptoms

Tomato mosaic virus symptoms can be found at any stage of growth and all parts of the plant may be infected. ToMV causes yellow mosaic symptoms on the leaves and tomato fruits. Tomato mosaic virus symptoms are seen as a general mottling or mosaic appearance on foliage. Light and darker green mosaic leaf mottle, sometimes with distortion of younger leaves; this is the most common reaction in summer in glasshouses. In winter, with low light intensity, short days and temperatures not above 20°C, plants are often severely stunted and leaves distorted to ‘fern-leaf’ or tendril shape, but mottling may be slight. Plants are less vigorous, and fruit yield is reduced by 3 to 23%. Tomato mosaic virus strains occur in Chenopodium murale in the USA, causing severe stunting, distortion and necrosis , and in pear associated with a diffuse chlorotic leaf spotting.

## Overview

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) can infect over 30 different kinds of plants, but it is mainly known to cause devastating losses of up to 100 per cent in the yield of tomatoes. Both field and glasshouse grown tomatoes are susceptible. TYLCV is vectored by silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). Following recent detections, silverleaf whitefly is now considered established in Victoria.

## Symptoms

- The most obvious symptoms in tomato plants are small leaves that become yellow between the veins. The leaves also curl upwards and towards the middle of the leaf
- In seedlings, the shoots become shortened and give the young plants a bushy appearance. In mature plants only new growths produced after infection is reduced in size. Although tomato production is reduced by the infection, the fruit appears unaffected.

## Overview

Damage from these diseases may range from a light spotting of the foliage to almost complete defoliation of the plant, with corresponding impacts on photosynthesis and production potential. When present, fruit lesions disfigure and reduce the marketability of both fresh-market and processing fruit (especially in whole-pack or diced product) and interfere with peeling. Defoliation exposes the fruit, resulting in sunscald and poor colour. Secondary rots can also develop.

## Symptoms

- The bacterial spot pathogen may produce lesions on all aboveground parts of the plant - leaves, stems, flowers and fruit. It is difficult to reliably distinguish bacterial spot from bacterial speck based on visual symptoms, especially in the early stages.
- Initial leaf symptoms are small, circular-to-irregular, dark lesions, which may be surrounded by a yellow halo. The lesions tend to concentrate on the leaf edges and tip and may increase in size to a diameter of 3-5 mm.
- Infected leaves may develop a scorched appearance. When spots are numerous, foliage turns yellow and eventually dies, leading to defoliation of the lower portion of the plant.

## Overview

Tomato blight is a disease caused by a fungus, depending on which type of blight is affecting the vegetable.
Tomato blight can affect almost all parts of a tomato plant, including the leaves, stems, and fruits. The plants may not die if they come down with the disease, but they will weaken and produce fewer tomatoes. Early blight generally attacks older plants, but it can also occur on seedlings. Stressed plants or plants in poor health are especially susceptible.

## Symptoms

- **On Older Plants**: Dark spots with concentric rings develop on older leaves first. The surrounding leaf area may turn yellow. Affected leaves may die prematurely, exposing the fruits to sun-scald.
- **On Tomato Fruits**: If early blight gets on the fruits, spots will begin at the stem end, forming a dark, leathery, sunken area with concentric rings. Both green and ripe tomatoes can be affected.
- **On Seedlings**: Affected seedlings will have dark spots on their leaves and stems. They may even develop the disease on their cotyledon leaves. Stems often wind up girdled.

## Overview

Tomato blight is a disease caused by a fungus, depending on which type of blight is affecting the vegetable. However, more than one type of blight can attack tomatoes at the same time. There are three types of tomato blight caused by different fungi that all present somewhat similarly.

## Symptoms

Late blight comes in the form of brown spots primarily on the plant's stem, with rapid spread and fungi growth in wet conditions. Spores will form on the diseased tissue.

- **Leaves**: The first symptoms of late blight on tomato leaves are irregularly shaped, water-soaked lesions, which are usually found on younger leaves. Spots will also appear on both sides of the leaves. As blight continues to take hold, leaves will become brown, shrivel, and die.6

- **Fruit**: Late blight can also take hold of the tomato fruit itself at any stage of the plant's development. You will notice rotten fruit has greasy brown spots that will eventually look and feel like leather.

## Overview

Tomato leaf mold is a foliar disease that is especially problematic in greenhouse and high tunnels. It was first described in 1883 as a pathogen that causes leaf lesions. It is less common in the field compared to greenhouses and high tunnels.
Tomato leaf mold is caused by a fungal pathogen called Passalora fulva (syn. Cladosporium fulvum). It is an ascomycete fungus that lives on living tomato leaves. The fungus produces conidia that infect the lower surfaces of leaves.

## Symptoms

Disease symptoms first appear after seven days as light green spots on leaves. Soon after, olive-green asexual conidia emerge, and eventually the spots become necrotic. Disease symptoms appear first on the lower leaves of tomato plants. Fruit production may not be severely hampered during the earlier stages of disease, but over time, disease severity increases and defoliation occurs. Proper identification of disease is important. Abiotic conditions such as magnesium deficiency and the beginning stages of other diseases can produce similar symptoms to tomato leaf mold.

## Overview

The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops in New England. Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. As with most pests, catching the problem early will mean easier control.

## Symptoms

Adult females are tiny; they can be seen with the naked eye but a 10x hand lens is very helpful. TSSM adults are about 1/50-inch long (1/2 mm), slightly orange or pale green in color, with two dark spots on their body. Initially, mites will feed on the undersides of leaves but in heavy infestations, they will move to the tops of leaves and onto fruit. Large populations will produce visible webbing that can completely cover the leaves. Mites hide under the webbing, making them difficult to reach with sprays.
